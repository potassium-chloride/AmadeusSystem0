# AmadeusSystem0
Prototype of Amadeus from Steins;Gate 0 world
This is test branch with Amadeus System bot which imitate Makise Kurise.
It has a lot of problems but I believe that I'll solve it.
Now, you can try to set tokens in file APIkeys.py
(values: ```YandexTranslate``` -- Yandex Translate API key, ```WF_APPID``` -- Wolfram Alpha API key, ```tgToken``` -- Telegram Bot API key),
start Desktop-nano or main_pseudotg and try to write to Kurisu (use Russian language).
